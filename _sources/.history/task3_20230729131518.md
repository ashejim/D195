# Task 3

The Conclusion -an overview video and detailed paper describing the implementation and results.

:::{tip}
For task 3, you will need to include a short Panopto video walking through your project and demonstrating the data analysis tools used. Go ahead and request access, [Panopto Access](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/), as gaining permission may *take up to 48 hours*.

## Have you Completed the Analysis Yet?

If you've followed our advice of completing the analysis before writing the proposal, Task 3 will mostly involve updating Task 2 to fit the Task 3 template and creating a summary video. If not, conduct your analysis now. Variances between Tasks 2 and 3 are allowed and may be appropriate if the analysis outcomes differ from what was expected.

:::{warning} ...and that's as far as I got.

## Writing Task 3

**Almost time to graduate!** Write your proposal following **Task 2: Project Proposal template**:

To gauge the level of detail evaluators typically expect, see the [task 2 examples](resources:examples) - passing, albeit not great, projects. Individual sections should be written to individually meet their respective rubric section requirements.

:::{tip}
Sections are assessed independently against the rubric requirements, i.e., when evaluating a section, the evaluator will *check for the fulfillment of the requirements within that section*. They *don't* assess writing style. You can (and sometimes must) reuse content from other areas as needed. It's not about writing something fun to read -it's about demonstrating that the competencies as defined by the rubric requirements are met.

## Grammar, Sources, and APA

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions!

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the 'Google doc' Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.
:::

Sources and format should follow [APA guidelines](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524). Avoid reference errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references and review this guide on how to [Avoid Common APA errors](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524?attachment-id=333).

While Writing Center Instructors cannot say whether a task will pass (no one but your specific evaluator can), they will help you revise your paper to meet WGU competency standards for professional communication, sources, and APA formatting. The Writing Center also offers live Q&A sessions.

## Overview Video

:::{tip}
For the overview video, you must use WGU's Panopto video service. You must request access, [Panopto Access](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/) and gaining permission may *take up to 48 hours*.
:::

The video provides an overview presentation of your project. Evaluators want to get a bird‚Äôs-eye view of your report and see how you conducted your analysis.

Here are the items you should cover:

1.	A summary of your research question or organizational need.
2.	A demonstration of the functionality of any code you used for your data analytics solution
3. An outline of the findings and implications of your analysis
 
The video should summarize your project's purpose and findings. You can think of this as a ‚Äúwater cooler‚Äù version of your report. The evaluator should be able to watch the video and understand your project‚Äôs purpose and main argument. Then, for step 2, bring your code (or software analysis) on screen and step through how you conducted your analysis.

There is no required length (maximum or minimum), but as its an overview 5-15 minutes is typically appropriate. Multimeida presentations tolls, such as Powerpoint, are not required but can

## FAQ

### What are the most common reasons task 3 does not pass?

The most common reasons for returned task 3's:

1. Grammar or Sources
2. "Insufficient details..." for one or more of the sections.
3. Missing technical details in F1.
4. No explicit examples in F2.
5. The data analysis tools (e.g., Python code) was not shown in the video.

The first item is easily avoidable. Being cited for "insufficient details" is a matter of subjectivity, but it is also easy to fix -just add more details. Since Task 3 mostly implements the already passed plan of Task 2 -it is mostly already passed.

### How long should task 3 be?

Review the [task 3 examples](resources:examples). As Task 3 mainly rewrites Task 2, but more succinctly, task 3 is typically shorter in length. However, there is no minimum page requirement, and they will assess Task 3 somewhat independently of Task 2.  

### My capstone is not a real project. What do I do for the deliverables?

See [section I](task3:I). You only need to provide *examples* of actual deliverables you might provide to clients demonstrating a project's completion.

(task3:faq:timeline)=

### I've completed task 3, but task 2 is still in the assessment queue. Should I wait until task 2 passes before I submit task 2?

If you're nearing the end of your term, you should submit task 3 as soon as it's ready. If task 2 gets returned, task 3 will also automatically be returned. However, if it passes, task 3 will keep its place in the assessment queue.
