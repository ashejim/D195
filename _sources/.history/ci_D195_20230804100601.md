# Course Faculty

The capstone was designed to showcase knowledge and skills accumulated throughout the DMDA degree program. Helping you integrate your accumulative expertise into a passing capstone is the primary responsibility of your assigned D195 course instructor. They will actively monitor your progress and offer one-on-one advice. They will discuss your progress, help you find answers to content questions, and give you tools to navigate the capstone successfully. Throughout your engagement with this course, it is expected that you continue communicating with your program mentor. Your program mentor will help you set weekly study goals, recommend specific learning materials, and tell you what to expect in this course and how it aligns with your programâ€™s competencies.

If your assigned course instructor is out of the office, you should contact [ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu](mailto:ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu?cc=your%20course%20instructor&subject=D195:%20capstone%20topic%20approval). Whether emailing [ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu](mailto:ugcapstoneit@wgu.edu?cc=my%20course%20instructor&subject=D195:%20capstone%20topic%20approval) or your CI directly, always practice professional communication:

- Use your WGU email (we may not receive emails from outside WGU).
- Provide a subject, your capstone course (we support all IT college capstones), and your program mentor's name (if not in your signature).
- Clearly state your questions or requests.

Dr. James Ashe is a dedicated maths, computer science, and statistics teacher with over 22 years of experience teaching in an online, large university, small college, HBCU, and community college setting. In 2016 he joined WGU to help students in the newly created Math Center. In 2018 Jim joined IT to contribute to the new Computer Science program. Currently, he supports the IT, data analytics, and computer science capstone. Though his research studied abstract objects, experimentation, creating examples, and producing necessitated a lot of coding. It was here that he developed a love for programming and computer science. He has a Ph.D. and MS in mathematics from the University of Tennessee and a BS in history with a minor in art from East Tennessee State University. Jim and his wife reside in Asheville, NC, with their four children, four cats, a dog, and an undetermined number of chickens. In his nonexistent spare time, he enjoys reading and kayaking.
