## Grammar, Sources, and APA

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions!

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.
:::

Sources and format should follow [APA guidelines](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524). Avoid reference errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references and review this guide on how to [Avoid Common APA errors](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524?attachment-id=333).

## FAQ

### What are the most common reasons task 3 does not pass?

The most common reasons for returned task 3's:

1. Grammar
2. Sources
3. No narrative for [part F, Project Timeline](task3:F).
4. Insufficient details for section X.

1-3 is easily avoidable. Being cited for "insufficient details" is a matter of subjectivity, but it is also easy to fix -just add more details. Since task 3 mostly implements the already passed plan of task 2 -it is mostly already passed.

### How long should task 3 be?

Review the [task 3 examples](resources:examples). As task 3 mainly rewrites task, task 3 is typically similar in length. They will assess task 3 independently of task 2. Don't assume they'll compare the two.  

### My capstone is not a real project. What do I do for the deliverables?

See [section I](task3:I). You only need to provide *examples* of actual deliverables you might provide to clients demonstrating a project's completion.

(task3:faq:timeline)=

### My task 2 timeline has projected end dates of 6 months (since this is what it would take), but I just submitted task 2 and need to complete task 3 now. What should I do?

Evaluators understand this is a written exercise, and academic timelines rarely sync with real-world timelines. *Write as if you recently completed the project* -dates do not need to align with those in task 2, but the task 3 start and end dates *must be in the past.* For example, if task 2 had the following:

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Duration  | Projected Start Date| Projected End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|<span style="color:red">**7/23/2031**</span>|<span style="color:red">**7/30/2031**</span>|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|<span style="color:red">**7/16/2031**</span>|<span style="color:red">**7/30/2031**</span>|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

But task 3 was submitted on 4/28/2023, it might be adjusted by moving back dates such that the timeframes are preserved as follows:

   |Milestone or Deliverable  |Planned Duration  | Actual Duration  | Actual Start Date| Actual End date
   --- | --- | ---| ---| ---|
   |Some milestones |7 days|7 days|<span style="color:green">**4/21/2023**</span>|<span style="color:green">**4/28/2023**</span>|
   |Some deliverables |14 days|14 days|<span style="color:green">**4/14/2023**</span>|<span style="color:green">**4/28/2023**</span>|
   |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

The narrative following the timeline can then explain that the project started earlier than expected (even if these dates preceded task 2's submission).

### I've completed task 3, but task 2 is still in the assessment queue. Should I wait until task 2 passes before I submit task 2?

If you're nearing the end of your term, you should submit task 3 as soon as it's ready. If task 2 gets returned, task 3 will also automatically be returned. However, if it passes, task 3 will keep its place in the assessment queue.
