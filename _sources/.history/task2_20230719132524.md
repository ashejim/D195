# Task 2

<!-- TODO START HERE: 7/13/2023 -->
Write your proposal following **Task 2: Project Proposal template**:
> [Task 2: the Proposal template](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/jim_ashe_wgu_edu/Ee2j1-f4p_pLp-v-sA6XpkYBRSlZ8pMxBsGAv6_YRsELOw?e=9dkG8a)

To gauge the level of detail evaluators typically expect, see the [task 2 examples](resources:examples) - passing, albeit not great, projects.

<div class = "tasklist">

   <input type="checkbox"> Pass [task 1](task1).

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete the data analysis which includes a statistical test for significance or model with a performance metric. Alternatively, this can be done before writing task 3, but some amount of data investigation should be done before completing A1.

   <!-- <input type="checkbox"> Watch *all* of the [**Task 2 videos**](resources:task2) (they are short). -->

   <input type="checkbox"> Review the corresponding task 2 section and then write that section to meet the rubric requirements independently. Here's a *suggested* order:

   <div class = "tasklist2">

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete A1. Most sections must align with your chosen research question or organizational need.

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete C4 & C1. A statistical test or model supporting A1 is *the only specific rigorous requirement in tasks 2 and 3 rubrics.* With this in place, the project has the necessary foundations to pass.

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete C2, C3, & C5. These sections describe the details, development, and practical application of C1 & C4.

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete C6. Graphs supporting C4 or describing the data used for C4.

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete D1-D5. These sections describe the data and data preparation necessary for C or other analyses.

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete B1-B6, the "business plan" for your project. This will outline and repeat parts C & D from a management perspective. 

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete A2, A4, A5. summarizing the project and its purpose.

   <input type="checkbox"> Complete A3. Include 3 works related to the project.

:::{tip}
Sections are assessed independently against the rubric requirements, i.e., when evaluating a section, the evaluator will *check for the fulfillment of the requirements within that section*. They *don't* assess writing style. You can (and sometimes must) reuse content from other areas as needed. It's not about writing something fun to read -it's about demonstrating that the requirements are met.
:::

(task2: do_the_analysis_now)=

## Do the Analysis Now!

Task 2 is written as a proposal. However, parts C of task 2 and F of task 3 require a specific type of data analysis. An inductive argument using descriptive methods will not meet the requirements of these sections. Analyzing the data before writing task 2 will help:

1. Ensure the minimum requirements of the project will be met.
2. Better align the research question/organization need with project outcomes.
3. Better align tasks 2 and 3 allowing task 3 to be completed faster.

Though more of an initial time investment, the analysis must be done at some point. Doing it first allows Task 2 to be written to known (rather than anticipated) results and allows Task 3 to be completed by (mostly) rewriting Task 2.

:::{wanring}
Throughout this page, we will be assuming you have completed the data analysis.
:::

(task2:A)=

## A: Proposal Overview

The Proposal Overview summarizes one question or organizational need that you intend to answer by collecting and analyzing a set of data. Think of as a summary meant to be read by upper managnement or a general audience.

This part serves introduces and summaries a thesis (A1), a literature review (A3), a problem (A2) and your solution (A4 & A5). This section can establish a roadmap for the rest of the paper, but if you write it first expect the need to revisit and revise it once other sections are complete. Remember to keep the introduction concise but informative, providing enough information to clearly meet the requirements of individual secitons.

(task1: A1)=

### A1 Research Question or Organizational Need

Much of Tasks 2 and 3 must align with this section. Particualry the rigorous method from part C. After investiagteing your data, you may need to adjust from what was provided in [Task 1](task1). Making changes from Task 1 is acceptable (and somewhat expected) without resubmitting Task 1. However, we recommend contacting your [assigned course intsructor](ci_page) if significant changes are necessary.

#### Research Question OR Organizational Need?

"Researech question or organizational need," is the language of the rubric. Addressing a research quesiton best fits the rubirc requriements, and any research question can be described to have an organizational benefit (the pragmatism of which is not assessed). So most projects should choose a research question and advice on this page will favor that direction.

#### What is a Research Question?

A research question should identify what your analysis plans to discover. For this projeect, it should be:

1. Narrow/specicifc enough to define an answerable question.
2. Supportable with a statistical test or model.
3. Feasible within your avaibale time, resources, and abilities.

Tradsitionally a good reaserch questions should also be interesting, releveant, and novel. However these characteristics are not directly or indirectly assessed as the capstone is meant to demonstrate proficiencies in analysis not scientific reserach. Particularly do not worry about the novelity of projects as we have no shareable  list of previous topics or investaigated datasets.

:::{note}
Many of the rubric requirements must align with A1. Particaulary [part C](task2:C). If you've followed the recommendation of first completing the analysis, your research question can be directly related to your [hypothesis](task2:C1)

(task1: A2)=

### A2 Context & Background

Briefly detail the project's background and provide enough context making the purpose of your project clear.

(task1: A3)=

### A3 & A3A Summary of Works & Project Relation

Think of this section as a literature review where you summarize a work (A3) and then relate it to your project (A3A). The need only connect to an aspect of your project; they don't need to align with it entirely. You can use anything created by an industry professional, e.g., online articles, whitepapers, technical documentation, etc. Most importantly, you must have **three** different works cited following [APA guidelines](task2:grammar) using in-text citations, e.g., (Author, year). Typically, papers cite sources as needed, but for evaluation purposes they added this section to demonstrate research.

1. **Review a work.** For example, online articles, blogs, case studies, white papers, videos, etc.
2. **Summarize the work.** Simply tell your reader what's in the resource you reviewed, no need to offer an opinion or analyze it -simply summarize the content. We recommend 1-2 paragraphs per work.
3. **Relate the work to your project.** Following the summary, describe how the work expands the context of the problem or supports the implementation solution.
4. **Include an APA style in-text citation,** e.g., (Author, year); follow  [APA guidelines and use the MS reference tool] see (task2:grammar)

- [WGU's library](https://wgu.libguides.com/friendly.php?s=library)
- [google.scholar.com](https://scholar.google.com/)

:::{tip}
Stuck? Return to this section later. You will likely collect sources while conducting research for other sections. The works do not have to be a one-to-one match to your project. What's accepted is very broad.

(task1: A4)=

### A4 Summary of Data Analytics Solution

Sumamrize the proposed solution. Include a summary of the analytic method(s) and its implementation summarized in [B3](task2:B3) and detailed in [C4](task2:C4). Detail how the solution:

- Will be realistically implemented.
- Address the research question or organizational need.

(task1: A5)=

### A5 Benefits & Support of Decision Making Process

Describe how the soltuion from A4 will:

- Provide a benefit and why.
- Assist in decision-making and why.

The benefit can directly or indirectly be related to solution assisting in decision-making.

(task2:B)=

## B: Data Analytics Project Plan

In this part, you will discuss the design details of your data analytics solution. Think of it as a business plan for [part C](task2:C) targetting middle management.

(task2:B1)=

### Goals, Objectives, & Deliverables

**Goals** and **objectives** are very similar. Goals are broader, defining the end you are trying to achieve (e.g., improving customer service). You need at least one goal. Objectives are more specific, often measurable steps supporting the goal (e.g., real-time inventory updates for customers). Goals and objectives can be considered high-level and mid-management tasks, respectively. **Deliverables** are tangible tasks completed supporting the objectives (e.g., an inventory status screen reporting real-time inventory to customers).

For this section you must,

- Describe each goal (every project should have at least one) 

- Describe each objective and how the objectives support the goal(s). 

- Describe each deliverable, and how each deliverable supports an objective.


**Example:** 

> - Goal 1: The goal of this project is to …
>     - Objective 1.1: Determine if …
>           - Deliverable 1.1.1: The deliverable for this objective is …
>           - Deliverable 1.1.2: The deliverable for this objective is … 
>     - Objective 1.2: Provide a …
>           - Deliverable 1.2.1: The deliverable for this objective is …

:::

(task2:C)=
### Rationale

The **Project Rationale** provides a comprehensive picture of *why* the project is needed. Describe the business, technical, and/or user needs. Internal and external environmental factors might also be included. 

(task2:D)=
### Current Environment

In the **Current Project Environment** section, describe:
1. The client's current state, e.g., number of employees, tech, software, etc.
2. What's wrong with the client's current state?
3. Why your solution fixes it?

(task2:E)=
### Methodology

In this section, you must

1. Identify a "standard" methodology used to plan the project, e.g., ADDIE or SDLC.
2. Describe the project steps to be completed in each phase of the methodology, e.g., analysis, design, etc.
Step 2 will provide a detailed implementation plan outline in section A2. Relate it to a "standard" methodology if using a less known methodology.

:::

(task2:G)=
### Project Timeline with Milestones

Create a table providing the *Duration*, *Projected start date*, and *Anticipated end date* for each milestone and deliverable. No additional information is needed. 

|Milestone or Deliverable  |Duration  | Projected Start Date| Projected End date
--- | --- | ---| ---|
|Some milestones |7 days|7/23/2022|7/30/2022|
|Some deliverables |14 days|7/16/2022|7/30/2022|
|$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |$\vdots$ |

```{note}
*All* dates must be in the future. Task 2 is a proposal. Write as if you are trying to convince the client to adopt your plan. Even if based on an already completed project, you should write task 2 as though it's yet to be done.
```

(task2:H)=
### Outcome

Provide objective, measurable criteria for success. You need specific details so that the conclusion report, task 3, can comparatively be used to show the project was a success. Time-based metrics work best, for example, from page 18 of the [task 2 example](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/resources/examples/BSNOS/example_task2-bsnos-a.pdf),

(task2:grammar)=

## Grammar, Sources, and APA

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions!

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google Doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.
:::

Sources and format should follow [APA guidelines](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524). Avoid reference errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references and review this guide on how to [Avoid Common APA errors](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524?attachment-id=333).

Get the best writing help from the writing experts: [WGU Writing Center](https://my.wgu.edu/success-centers/writing-center). While Writing Center Instructors cannot say whether a task will pass (no one but your specific evaluator can), they will help you revise your paper to meet WGU competency standards for professional communication, sources, and APA formatting. The Writing Center also offers live Q&A sessions. See a list of upcoming events here: [Writing Center Live Events](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/Writing-Center-Live-Events/ta-p/36860).

(task2:faq)=
## FAQ

### I've completed task 2. Should I send it to my course instructor for review?

If you have specific questions or concerns -yes. However, in most cases, it's best just to submit. What suffices as “sufficient detail” is highly subjective. We can always tell you to add more, but if you've done your best to fulfill the requirements, submit it and let them tell you which (if any) parts need to be rewritten. At best, it passes; at worst, we address the issues cited by the evaluator -and then it passes. Responding to the more narrow focus of the evaluator's comments is generally easier than overworking the entire project.

You have *unlimited* submissions but limited time. And, typically this is the best and most efficient approach. 

### The task 2 template has suggested page lengths. Are these lengths required?

No. Those are just suggestions. The individual evaluator determines what qualifies as "sufficient detail" and will vary depending on the project and writing style. If you feel you've met the requirements, simply move on to the next section. Upon submission, it will pass, or they will request more details.

### How many submission attempts do I have?

You have unlimited submissions (as with all WGU performance assessments). Furthermore, a project requiring multiple submissions is not precluded from being given an excellence award. However, do attempt to fully meet *each* requirement as submissions falling significantly short of the minimum requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Moreover, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments.   

### I can't find sources for section B, *Other Works*. What can I do?

You are likely overinterpreting what's required. Rarely are submissions sent back because cited works are unsuitable. You can use referenceable work created by a professional which can be *related* to your project -it does not need to align with your project entirely. For example, a cloud migration project might include articles about AWS, security advantages, cost advantages, etc. 

### My task two was returned for *sources* stating:

> "In-text citations could not be found for portions of the task that have been quoted or paraphrased... "
**What does this comment mean?**

It indicates they could not find a matching in-text citation for every source on your reference list. Check that each reference has a match following APA style, e.g., (Author, year), and remove any references without matches. Use the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create, manage references, and avoid such errors. Follow the in-text citations and the reference page format of the [tasks 2 and 3 examples](resources:examples).
