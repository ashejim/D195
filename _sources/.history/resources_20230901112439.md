The [Capstone Excellence Archive](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/capstonearchives/excellence/Pages/UndergraduateInformation.aspx) includes a wide range of completed projects. When reviewing archived capstones, keep in mind that they all are, by definition, *above and beyond* the requirements. Therefore, do not use these as examples of what's needed to meet the requirements. For a more down-to-earth example of what's required, see the above [Examples](resources:examples) section.

### Grammarly.com

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.

### Welcome email

We've tried to provide everything you need here on this website as a more complete and readily available resource than the "welcome email," i.e., the *non-automated* introductory email from your assigned course instructor containing the tips and resources needed to get started in the right direction. However, we often get asked for the email, and I suppose this website would be incomplete without it. So here is an example of a "welcome email."

```{admonition} A Welcome Email
Welcome to D195! Please review our [D195 website](https://ashejim.github.io/D195/intro.html) to get almost everything you need. The capstone can be very similar to a combination of tasks 1 and 2 from the [Intro to Data Analysis& Practical Statistics (Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree part 1/5)](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd002-wgu-1) course you passed in fullfilment of the C749 -Intro to Data Science course. Additionally, review these [task 1, task 2, and task 3 examples](resources: examples). 
Your first step is choosing a topic.

1. Review the Proposal (task 2) and Conclusion Report(task 3) rubric requirements found on your D195 COS page, particularly C of task 2 and F of task 3; review the [task 1, task 2, and task 3 examples](resources: examples). Consider an argument supportable using a statistical significance; listen to [C964/D195 Statistical Significance](https://d2y36twrtb17ty.cloudfront.net/sessions/d8c9630b-274a-4879-bf27-ae2a011e3dbd/ec782192-a9bf-459f-b091-ae2a011e3dc8-8a3dfb1b-4294-4074-9d33-ae2a011e752c.mp4?invocationId=abd666da-b37f-ec11-828b-12b1cb861383) in the [WGU IT Audio series](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/it-audio-series.html#close).
2. Choose your dataset first; avoid proposing a project for which you do not yet have data, and avoid choosing a dataset before understanding the Task 2 and 3 requirements. A popular place for datasets is [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). You will need to make an argument supporting a hypothesis using appropriate data analytic methods; consider an idea supportable with hypothesis testing, e.g., claims about correlations, means, proportions, etc., as using statistical significance best fits the requirements. 
3. Explore your data before settling on a topic. It is also advisable to complete your data analysis before completing the Proposal (task 2) as you won't need to anticipate results. Furthermore, completing task 3 and aligning it to task 2 will be easier. 
4. Compose your Topic Approval Form using the [D195 Topic Approval Form](https://github.com/ashejim/D195/blob/main/resources/D195_Topic_Approval_Form.docx) and send it to your [assigned course instructor](ci_page). If more information is needed, I'll let you know. Use this   task 1 example as a guide to the expected detail.
5.Submit the Topic Approval Form (signed by your assigned instruictor).

Let us know if you have any questions. Emails are best (and fastest) for specific questions -appointments for general discussions. Though whatever your preference is fine.

```

```{warning}
Be aware that task 2 and 3 evaluations often take the full three days. Therefore, if you are approaching the end of your term, don't wait on task 2 to start task 3 and submit task 3 early enough to have it returned, revised, and resubmitted.
```
