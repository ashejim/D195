## FAQ

### I've completed task 2. Should I send it to my course instructor for review?

If you have specific questions or concerns -yes. However, in most cases, it's best just to submit. What suffices as “sufficient detail” is highly subjective. We can always tell you to add more, but if you've done your best to fulfill the requirements, submit it and let them tell you which (if any) parts need to be rewritten. At best, it passes; at worst, we address the issues cited by the evaluator -and then it passes. Responding to the more narrow focus of the evaluator's comments is generally easier than overworking the entire project.

You have *unlimited* submissions but limited time. And, typically this is the best and most efficient approach. 

### How long should task 2 be? Is there a page length required?

No. The individual evaluator determines what qualifies as "sufficient detail" and will vary depending on the project and writing style. If you feel you've met the requirements, simply move on to the next section. Upon submission, it will pass, or they will request more details.

### How many submission attempts do I have?

You have unlimited submissions (as with all WGU performance assessments). Furthermore, a project requiring multiple submissions is not precluded from being given an excellence award. However, do attempt to fully meet *each* requirement as submissions falling significantly short of the minimum requirements may be *locked* from further submissions without instructor approval. Moreover, such submissions do not receive meaningful evaluator comments. 

### I can't find sources for section A3, *Summary of Published Works*. What can I do?

You are likely overinterpreting what's required. Rarely are submissions sent back because cited works are unsuitable. You can use any referenceable work created by a professional which can be *related* to your project -it does not need to align with your project entirely. For example, an article about your chosen analytical method or tools would suffice.

### My task two was returned for *sources* stating:

> "In-text citations could not be found for portions of the task that have been quoted or paraphrased... "
**What does this comment mean?**

It indicates they could not find a matching in-text citation for every source on your reference list. Check that each reference has a match following APA style, e.g., (Author, year), and remove any references without matches. Use the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create, manage references, and avoid such errors. Follow the in-text citations and the reference page format of the [tasks 2 and 3 examples](resources:examples).
