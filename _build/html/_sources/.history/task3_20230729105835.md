## Have you Completed the Analysis Yet? 

If you've followed our advice of completing the analysis before writing the proposal, Task 3 will mostly involve updating Task 2 to fit the Task 3 template and creating a summary video. If not,

## Grammar, Sources, and APA

It's easy to overlook them when focusing on content, but grammar, sources, and APA formatting are the most common reasons for rejected submissions!

Check your grammar using [Grammarly.com](https://www.grammarly.com/) ![grammarly_icon](https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/url_images/icon-grammarly.png?raw=true#icon) (it's what the evaluators use). Style is not assessed (Grammarly marks these in blue, green, or purple), but even a few grammar errors (marked in red) will prevent competency in *Professional Communication*. The free side has been sufficient, but if using the online app, you sometimes need to wait before mistakes are caught.

:::{warning}
Students have reported missed mistakes when using the Google doc Grammarly extension. Therefore, we advise copying content directly into the app or purchasing the premium version compatible with MS Word.
:::

Sources and format should follow [APA guidelines](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524). Avoid reference errors by using the [MS Word Reference Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-bibliography-citations-and-references-17686589-4824-4940-9c69-342c289fa2a5) to create and manage references and review this guide on how to [Avoid Common APA errors](https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Writing-Center-Knowledge-Base/I-Need-Help-with-APA-Style/ta-p/33524?attachment-id=333).

## FAQ

### What are the most common reasons task 3 does not pass?

The most common reasons for returned task 3's:

1. Grammar
2. Sources
3. Insufficient details for section X.

1 and 2 are easily avoidable. Being cited for "insufficient details" is a matter of subjectivity, but it is also easy to fix -just add more details. Since Task 3 mostly implements the already passed plan of Task 2 -it is mostly already passed.

### How long should task 3 be?

Review the [task 3 examples](resources:examples). As Task 3 mainly rewrites Task 2, but more succinctly, task 3 is typically shortet in length. However, there is no minimum page requirement, and they will assess Task 3 somewhat independently of Task 2.  

### My capstone is not a real project. What do I do for the deliverables?

See [section I](task3:I). You only need to provide *examples* of actual deliverables you might provide to clients demonstrating a project's completion.

### I've completed task 3, but task 2 is still in the assessment queue. Should I wait until task 2 passes before I submit task 2?

If you're nearing the end of your term, you should submit task 3 as soon as it's ready. If task 2 gets returned, task 3 will also automatically be returned. However, if it passes, task 3 will keep its place in the assessment queue.
