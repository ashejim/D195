The purpose of the capstone is to showcase knowledge and skills accumulated throughout your BSDMDA degree program. Helping you integrate your accumulative expertise into a passing capstone is the primary responsibility of your assigned D195 course instructor. However, the capstone was designed by WGU with the expectation that the necessary skills have already been mastered. So questions regarding those skills, e.g., statitics, coding, analysis, etc.; may be outside the scope of your assigned course instructor's expertise (the capstone faculty team supports *all* capstones in the undergraduate IT college).

```{margin}  Which courses are these skills covered?
Most notably Intro to Data Science -C749. Other courses which may apply depending on your project are Machine Learning -C753, Data Analysis with R -C751, and Data Wranglging -D309. C749 covers skills which meet the minimum requirements, but the introductory inferential statitsics covered may be insufficient in multivariable, categorical, or non-parametric methods are needed. So choose your project accordingly. BUT the true asset of a Data *Ananlysis* graduate, is the ability to adapt, learn, and problem solve. Something you've done plenty of and should expect to do your entire career.    
```

In cases when that happens, your D195 instructor will help direct you to the correct resource. But given the broad range of approaches methods, languages, and libraries available to use, it should not be expected to find an available WGU expert on everything. We recommend reviewing available resources *before* investing time into your project and being aware that WGU resources might be limited when choosing tools outside the scope of those listed.

Always practice professional communication:

* Use your WGU email (we may not receive emails from outside WGU).
* Provide a subject, your capstone course (we support all IT college capstones), and your program mentor's name (if not in your signature).
* Clearly state your questions or requests. When contacting non-C964 faculty, provide context and limit questions to the scope of their expertise.
