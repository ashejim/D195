:::{warning}
Faculty not assigned to you, in particular non-D195 faculty,  are happy to help any WGU student. But students assigned to them take priority.  Follow the guidelines below, and understand their assistance is a courtesy and that response times may be delayed (particularly towards the end of the month).

## Better questions get better answers

The fix might need an understanding of several intertwined layers, of your code structure, the language, libraries, or data. You've already spent hours working on it. Don't expect someone else to quickly diagnose and fix the issue from a quick live code section or a series of screenshots. Remember, asking for help means asking for someone's time. Faculty on this page enjoy helping students (they've volunteered for the additional work), but you need to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.

**Coding-related questions should be emailed following these guidelines:**

- Clearly state the problem you are trying to fix. 
- Describe how to recreate the problem. 
- Provide everything needed to reproduce the error. Preferably a minimal working example. Do *NOT* rely on screenshots. 
- Describe what you've tried already; some [debugging tips](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-debugging-how-to-debug-code/). 
- Start with the simplest error. Focus on one problem at a time.

**Additionally, always practice professional communication:**

- Use your WGU email (we may not receive emails from outside WGU).
- Provide a subject, your capstone course (we support all IT college capstones), and your program mentor's name (if not in your signature).
- Clearly state your question, provide context, and do not assume the faculty on this page knows the requirements of your project. Restrict the scope of your question to their area of expertise.

## WGU Programming Center

The [WGU Programming Center](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/ProgrammingCenter) provides support to all WGU students in learning basic programming concepts, R, JavaScript, and Python.

Dr. James Ashe is a dedicated maths, computer science, and statistics teacher with over 20 years of experience teaching in an online, large university, small college, HBCU, and community college setting. In 2016 he joined WGU to help students in the newly created Math Center. In 2018 Jim joined IT to contribute to the new Computer Science program. Currently, he supports the IT, data analytics, and computer science capstone. Though his research studied abstract objects, experimentation, creating examples, and producing necessitated a lot of coding. It was here that he developed a love for programming and computer science. He has a Ph.D. and MS in mathematics from the University of Tennessee and a BS in history with a minor in art from East Tennessee State University. Jim and his wife reside in Asheville, NC, with their four children, four cats, a dog, and an undetermined number of chickens. In his nonexistent spare time, he enjoys reading and kayaking.
