Helping you integrate your accumulative expertise into a passing capstone is the primary responsibility of your assigned D195 course instructor. However, the capstone was designed by WGU with the expectation that the necessary skills have already been mastered. So questions regarding those skills, e.g., statitics, coding, analysis, etc.; may be outside the scope of your assigned course instructor’s expertise (the capstone faculty team supports all capstones in the undergraduate IT college).\n\nWhich courses are these skills covered?\n\nMost notably Intro to Data Science -C749. Other courses which may apply depending on your project are Machine Learning -C753, Data Analysis with R -C751, and Data Wranglging -D309. C749 covers skills which meet the minimum requirements, but the introductory inferential statitsics covered may be insufficient in multivariable, categorical, or non-parametric methods are needed. So choose your project accordingly. BUT the true asset of a Data Ananlysis graduate, is the ability to adapt, learn, and problem solve. Something you’ve done plenty of and should expect to do your entire career.\n\nIn cases when that happens, your D195/D502 instructor will help direct you to the correct resource. But given the broad range of approaches methods, languages, and libraries available to use, it should not be expected to find an available WGU expert on everything. We recommend reviewing available resources before investing time into your project and being aware that WGU resources might be limited when choosing tools outside the scope of those listed.","type":"content","url":"/ci-page","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Course Faculty","lvl2":"Who to contact?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ci-page#who-to-contact","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Course Faculty","lvl2":"Who to contact?"},"content":":::{card}\n:margin: 3\n:class-body: text-center\n:class-header: bg-light text-center\n:link: ./ci_d195.html\n\n**D195/D502 Faculty**\n^^^\n\n```{image} ./url_images/virtual_meeting1.jpg\n:height: 100\n:alt: A person in a video conference on their laptop with a CI. \n```\n\nUnderstanding the project<br>\nRevising returned projects<br>\nTopic approval<br>\nPlanning & resources\n+++\nD195/D502 CI page {fas}`arrow-right`\n:::\n\n:::{card}\n:margin: 3\n:class-body: text-center\n:class-header: bg-light text-center\n:link: ./ci_other.html\n\n**DMDA, Math, & Software Faculty**\n^^^\n\n```{image} ./url_images/debug1.jpg\n:height: 100\n:alt: A magnifying glass looking at code sees \"error.\"\n```\n\nDebugging Python and Java <br>\nData processing <br>\nData Analytics <br>\nStatistics, Math, & ML\n\n+++\nDMDA, Math, & Software CI page {fas}`arrow-right`\n:::\n\nAlways practice professional communication:\n\nUse your WGU email (we may not receive emails from outside WGU).\n\nProvide a subject, your capstone course (we support all IT college capstones), and your program mentor’s name (if not in your signature).\n\nClearly state your questions or requests.

Review the \n\nTask 1 guide page and the \n\nProposal (task 2) requirements (particularly \n\nsection C4 requiring a model or test). You will need to support a hypothesis using a model or statistical test. So, choose data suitable for a method you are comfortable with. A popular place for datasets is \n\nkaggle.com.\n\nExplore the data before settling on a topic. Complete your data analysis before completing the Proposal (task 2), as you won’t need to anticipate results. Furthermore, completing task 3 and aligning with task 2 will be easier.\n\nSubmit Task 1. Compose your Topic Approval Form using the \n\nTopic Approval Form Template and send it to your assigned course intsructor. If more information is needed, we’ll let you know. Submit the Topic Approval Form (signed by any D195/D502 CI). You only need the waiver form if using proprietary data or information.\n\nLet us know if you have any questions. Emails are best (and fastest) for specific questions -appointments for general discussions. Though whatever your preference is fine.

The overlap of methods, algorithms, language, etc., makes the two at times indistinguishable. But they are different. Statistics is a mathematical science while ML is an approach to solving problems that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive, e.g., very large datasets. Similar to how calculus is related to engineering, statistics is one of many tools used by ML, and like engineering ML focuses on results and application.

Then, for step 2, bring your code (or software analysis) on screen and step through how you conducted your analysis. Unfortunately, we don’t have an example video. However, the video is rarely rejected -unless it’s missing step 2 above.\n\nAfter recording the video, upload it to the Panopto drop box and retrieve its URL. In section H of your Task 3 documentation, provide the URL link to your Panopto video. You also copy and paste the URL into the ‘Links’ options when submitting Task 3.\n\nYou are required to use Panopto, and you need to first request access, \n\nPanopto Access.

If you need special accommodations, please contact Assessment Services and alert your assigned course faculty.\n\nThere is no minimum or maximum length, but it is not meant to be long (in-depth details belong in the paper).
